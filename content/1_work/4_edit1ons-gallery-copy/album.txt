They craved individuality and needed us to convey it, setting them apart in a competitive field. \nTheir goal was to build trust, loyalty, and to revolutionise the way art is acquired - through limited editions of genuine artworks online.","titletwo":"Discovery - The Design Challenge ↓","paragraphtwo":"In immersive brand strategy workshops, we unraveled the essence of EDIT1ONS. We discovered a diverse array of artworks within their \ngallery, necessitating a visual identity that could gracefully accommodate varying styles and aesthetics. Flexibility and versatility were paramount, ensuring that EDIT1ONS would never be confined to a specific artistic stereotype. We envisioned an identity that celebrated the artwork, framing it like a masterpiece, while remaining distinct but never overshadowing the art. Our challenge was to strike the perfect balance between subtlety and uniqueness.","titlethree":"","paragraphthree":"","titlefour":"","paragraphfour":""},"id":"520b6546-5c9a-4c61-bb2f-c193ecbe1689","isHidden":false,"type":"paragraph"},{"content":{"image":["file://kAl0sqQe3FbMnPnp"],"toptitleblack":"","bottomtitlegrey":""},"id":"b35983da-e1fc-4231-bd9d-5108158761ce","isHidden":false,"type":"singleimage"},{"content":{"image":["file://XK5zyzfYrbIgcgD8"],"toptitleblack":"","bottomtitlegrey":""},"id":"19ce24a5-ecba-4130-a928-34b84059b850","isHidden":false,"type":"alignrightsingleimage"},{"content":{"titleone":"Our Approach ↓","paragraphone":"We were inspired by the concept of framing, the art of presenting and enhancing artwork in physical galleries, and translated it into the digital realm. The adaptable wordmark, delicately framing a corner of the featured art, became the foundation of our design system. This idea expanded into an entire treatment for all graphic elements, ensuring that every aspect of the visual identity was framed, contained, and presented in a unique individual manner.","titletwo":"The Outcome ↓","paragraphtwo":"We crafted a timeless and infinitely adaptable brand identity system that seamlessly complements any artwork housed in the gallery. This simple yet powerful solution allows the identity to shift, shape, and mould itself around the art, while remaining distinct and recognisable.","titlethree":"","paragraphthree":"","titlefour":"","paragraphfour":""},"id":"4ae502e8-b690-4060-a2cb-93577dd988ff","isHidden":false,"type":"paragraph"},{"content":{"image":["file://2BC9UpIMVgGRnL9A"],"toptitleblack":"","bottomtitlegrey":""},"id":"35ae07ff-2417-45ee-afa8-265ca31fb055","isHidden":false,"type":"singleimage"},{"content":{"imageone":["file://hnFDtRODcgDp0FvY"],"imagetwo":["file://uJnUoXXGA46PTd27"],"toptitleblackleft":"","toptitleblackright":"","bottomtitlegreyleft":"","bottomtitlegreyright":""},"id":"a7b6aa43-d7d0-4304-a677-423c5c3cd61f","isHidden":false,"type":"duoimage"},{"content":{"imageone":["file://Fr8SHyTGalV8WPBA"],"imagetwo":["file://QjSkslnujl1TO37W"],"toptitleblackleft":"","toptitleblackright":"","bottomtitlegreyleft":"","bottomtitlegreyright":""},"id":"cf2c6c30-cea6-4355-b891-f65467b75258","isHidden":false,"type":"duoimage"},{"content":{"titleone":"","paragraphone":"The brand identity predominantly features a minimalist black and white palette, thoughtfully selected to ensure the artwork takes centre stage online.
